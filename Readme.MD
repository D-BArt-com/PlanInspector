# PlanInspector

PlanInspector is a tool to analyze query plans that have been captured through Extended events.

## To use PlanInspector, follow these steps

### Step 1

Capture query plans, you can use `XE_query_post_execution_plan_profile.sql` in the `SQL_Scripts` folder as an example.  
These plans will be written to `.XEL` files on your server.

### Step 2

Adjust the `Variables.xml` file:

| Variable Name | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| `ServerName`  | the name of the server where we'll create the output database in 'Step3' |
| `XelFolder`   | the folder with the XE files with the captured query plans <br> e.g. :  <br> - `c:\temp\XEL` <br> - `\\SRV1\Share\XEL`  |
| `DbName`      | if you want to change the name of the output database (we'll call this database `PLANUSAGEINFO`) |

### Step 3

Start the script `Invoke-Scripts.ps1`, this will execute 3 other scripts:  

| Variable Name | Action |
| ------------- | ------ |
| `Build-Database.ps1` | Creates the `PLANUSAGEINFO` database. |
| `Import-Xel.ps1` | Imports the XEL files into `PLANUSAGEINFO`. |
| `Write-Data.ps1` | Parses the XML of the query plans and writes the output to `PLANUSAGEINFO`. |

### Step 4

Analyze the output through the views on the `PLANUSAGEINFO` database.  

| View Name | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| vw_Actuals | compare Estimated to Actual rows |
| vw_Compile_TimeOut | queries who timed out during compilation |
| vw_Converted_Plans | converts query plans to xml format |
| vw_Duration | information about CPU en duration also for UDF |
| vw_Hashes | XE events doesn't store hashes in varbinary format, use this view to compare different hash formats |
| vw_Memory_PercentUsed | how much of the granted memory was used? |
| vw_MemoryGrantFeedbackAdjusted | queries with memory grant feedback |
| vw_Missing_Index | querie plans with missing index requests |
| vw_Multiple_Plans_Per_QueryHash | queries with multiple plans |
| vw_NonParallelPlanReason | why didn't this query run multi-threaded? |
| vw_Parallel_Skew | Compares load on the different threads of a parallel operator |
| vw_ParameterList | Shows the parameters that were used, compiled and runtime values |
| vw_PlanWarning_ColumnsWithNoStatistics | warnings about columns with no statistics |
| vw_PlanWarning_ColumnsWithStaleStatistics | warnings about stale statistics |
| vw_PlanWarning_ExchangeSpillDetails | warnings about Exchange spills |
| vw_PlanWarning_HashSpillDetails | warnings about Hash spills |
| vw_PlanWarning_MemoryGrantWarning | warnings about memory grants |
| vw_PlanWarning_NoJoinPredicate | warnings about joins without a predicate |
| vw_PlanWarning_Overview | overview of all the different warnings |
| vw_PlanWarning_PlanAffectingConvert | warnings about converts |
| vw_PlanWarning_SortSpillDetails | warnings about sort spills |
| vw_PlanWarning_SpillToTempDb | warnings about spills to tempdb |
| vw_PlanWarning_UnmatchedIndexes | warnings about Unmatched indexes |
| vw_PlanWarning_Wait | warnings about waits |
| vw_QueryWithUdf | queries with user defined functions |
| vw_Statistics_Not_Updated_Last_7_Days | statistics that are not updated in the last 7 days |
| vw_TraceFlags | queries who used traceflags |
